## Who can join the projects

The project is open for all, anyone can contribute.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Hibat Platform.
To start you can follow this steps:

-   fork the repo (by clicking on the fork button on the Repo page)
-   clone your repo to your device
-   pick a task from [Trello board](https://trello.com/hibatapp) or one issue on [gitHub issues](https://github.com/HibatApp/hibat-backend/issues)
-   write your code, test, commit and push
-   create a pull request to main Repo, someone should review and approve or give you feedback how to improve your code

## API Spec's contributing guideline

-   Use [Petstore example](https://editor.swagger.io/) From swagger as reference (convert it to openApi 3 from Edit menu)
-   Download OpenApi extension for your IDE, ex [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi) which give you: error highlights, auto fixing, live view, security audit and **code score**.
-   The end point should be POST, GET, PATCH, PUT /user, not /signin /signup /getUserInfo /updateUser
-   It would be easier for Frontend developers if we used **requestBody** content as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead of `application/json`, you can then test it using form inputs
-   please use camelCase, like fullName instead of full_name, as in [Petstore example](https://editor.swagger.io/)
-   please add the main details about properties, like maxlength or pattern, depending on property type, in vs code you can use CTL + . to quick fix it, you need openApi extension to be installed first
-   it would be better to use 400 instead of "400" for http response code
-   after finish, try to format the code (Alt+Shift+f in vscode)
-   before submit your pull request, make an audit test, using the openApi extension (click on purple icon to the top right), keep the code score over 50 out of 100 ðŸ˜Š
